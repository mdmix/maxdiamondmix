          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>I plan to make the most of this portfolio website by highlighting a mix of my new in-progress Wed Development skills, with my lucky international life-experience, and my wide-ranging video visuals – from the classical to the edgy.
          <br>My humble-experiece-based hope is to mesh all of that into something that stands out online, shaped by my extensive oversight of projects, my instincts as to what matters, what's logical, rational, optimally interactive. I'd like to think that some intense, serious themes, as well as some absurd, fun ones will mix together well.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>All in all, my flexible gameplan is to quickly get into a good course-day-to-day-rhythm that feels properly immersive, in line with my level of motivation, while I also strike the right balance between this stimulating course, and everything else I have to focus on in my life. <br>In terms of the nitty-gritty, I'll aim to totalize 20-25 hours of studying per week, by gradually devoting my mornings to the course, more and more exclusively.</p>

          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>The core purpose I had in mind, when deciding to dive headfirst into this course, was to expand my skills into the extremely stimulating, rational-looking field of coding, beyond what I know about editing, and directing live events or shoots, and my hope thereby is to establish a strong, stable work-foundation that's positive on many levels. <br>The idea is that as a Web Developer I could either, more easily than with video, find part-time, or full-time work, or very regular freelance gigs, keep on intensely developing my developer skills, combine them with my video skills, and make the most of my free-time to initiate personal video projects – with the peace-of-mind that my WD work combines job-stability with challenges I really relish.</p>

        <h3>Work + Life Overview</h3>
        <p>
        I feel naturally connected to many places all at once, as I have happily developed first-hand familiarity with quite a few major cities.
        Through stimulating, startling bursts of experiences, I grew up, studied and worked, very frequently on-the-move, from one gripping place to another: notably Johannesburg, London, Paris, New York, London again, Berlin, with some vivid, amusing, or absurd pitstops on-the-way.
        <br></br>
        The major highlight of my career was my co-creation and then flying-solo management of my own London Video Prod Startup, to which I was whole-heartedly committed day-in-day-out, and which represented a sensational opportunity for me, with my great team, to reliably produce all kinds of impactful, professional, and purposeful Audio-Visual content.
        <br></br>
        As the Technical Director, and sometimes Stage Manager, of multiple Festivals, I took much pride in ensuring that all simultaneous events would have pristine customized setups, arranged by me and my on-hand ultra-dependable team.

              <br>All of that, the various forms of logic required, great attention to detail, matching what’s happening on the ground with my Festival and IT gameplans, and my visual creativity, all of that translates into a meaningful combination of skills needed to make my coding actually take shape, in tune with my ideas, and maybe yours.

              As much as I relish taking the initiative when I’m committed to my projects, or someone else’s, I also feel very fulfilled co-creating something with stimulating collaborators, as the buzz from that kind of work-relationship can be wonderfully engrossing and inspirational.
              <br>In my mind, when everyone is more or less on the same wavelength, that type of team-blending can feel very rewarding, and like the optimal approach.
              <br>So, in short, I’m open to taking on any kind of role at the helm by myself, or with you.

              I love all challenges, the newer and more multi-faceted they are the better.
              <br>Each one, thematically known to me, or brand new, is above all else an opportunity for me to whole-heartedly commit to it.
              <br>As my track-record highlights, the purpose of my projects has varied immensely, from the in-depth-classical kind, to the fun, experimental, edgy sort, from promos to documentaries, and musical montages, all full of insights that naturally add much potential to my coding skillset.

              From the more creative or strategic teamwork, to a vibrant, feel-good workflow, my core purpose is always to make the project-experience highly productive, smooth, and fresh.
              <br>And to make clear 'big picture' plans within it, to commit wholeheartedly to the most urgent tasks, to be engaged lock, stock, and barrel with all projects to make the most of all of them - and to add to my own ‘in-the-thick-of-things’ enthusiasm.
              <br>I love feeling, from the inside, the various forms of the collaborative team spirit in the heat of the deadline-meeting action.
              And in collaborators, the spreading motivation and focus, with professional camaraderie, in an atmosphere which is heartily encouraging and rewarding for people who give it their all.
              <br>Crucially, the springboard for all of this is my passionate urge to have a ‘hands-on’ attitude, to make others feel that I am utterly committed, and that a positive, down-to-earth respectful mindset is what I add to the mix.

        <h1>Potential Conversations</h1>
        <p>Having had a wide-ranging mix of work-and-life experiences, resulting from good fortune or choices I made, I'm open to anything novel, classical, edgy, that requires some or all of my skills.
        Down-to-earth, challenging, straight-forward, local, international, or whatever else, I've dived headfirst into all of that.
        So I feel comfortable taking on any project requiring a specific mix of skills, experience, and instincts.
